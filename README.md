Hey there, this is my program I have developed which brings my passion of music and computing together.
This program allows the users to be able to stream audio (their voice, piece of music) etc and output its corresponding key and notes in real time. 
The captured key and notes can be convert onto a musical notation sheet which can be later printed.
